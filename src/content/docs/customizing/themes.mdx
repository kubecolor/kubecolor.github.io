## Default color scheme

As of version v0.3.0, `kubecolor` bundles new themes (also referred to as "presets"):

| Preset                                      | Description
| ------                                      | -----------
| `dark` *(default)*                          | For when your terminal's background is dark.
| `light`                                     | For when your terminal's background is light/bright.
| `pre-0.0.21-dark`, `pre-0.0.21-light`        | Original color scheme used before v0.0.21, as well as in the predecessor's ([hidetatz/kubecolor](https://github.com/hidetatz/kubecolor)) version.
| `pre-0.3.0-dark`, `pre-0.3.0-light`          | Color scheme used before the introduction of configurable themes in v0.3.0, where we also updated the default theme.
| `protanopia-dark`, `protanopia-light`        | Color theme for [Protanopia color blindness](https://www.color-blindness.com/protanopia-red-green-color-blindness/).
| `deuteranopia-dark`, `deuteranopia-light`(*) | Color theme for [Deuteranopia color blindness](https://www.color-blindness.com/deuteranopia-red-green-color-blindness/).
| `tritanopia-dark`, `tritanopia-light`(*)     | Color theme for [Tritanopia color blindness](https://www.color-blindness.com/tritanopia-blue-yellow-color-blindness/).

Kubecolor uses the `dark` theme by default.

  <TabItem label="light">

  <TabItem label="protanopia-dark">

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="deuteranopia-dark">

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="tritanopia-dark">
    <SvgCommandOutput name="kubectl-get-pods-tritanopia.svg" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
(*) As of version `v0.3.0`, both `deuteranopia` and `tritanopia` themes are the same as `protanopia`.
They may differ in future versions when we better tune them.
Set your configuration to match your color-blindness type so you will benefit of the future changes.
[We gladly accept suggestions](https://github.com/kubecolor/kubecolor/issues/new) on how to improve them.

## Switching to a different color theme

There's three way to switch to a different color theme:

- Temporarily for a single command using the `--kubecolor-theme` flag:

  ```bash
  kubecolor get pods --kubecolor-theme=protanopia-dark
  ```

- Setting the environment variable `KUBECOLOR_PRESET` to a specific theme:

  ```bash
  # ~/.bashrc
  export KUBECOLOR_PRESET="protanopia-dark"
  ```

- Configuring the default theme in the configuration file at `~/.kube/color.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  # ~/.kube/color.yaml
  preset: protanopia-dark
  ```

## Light Theme

you can switch to the light theme by either:

- setting the variable `KUBECOLOR_LIGHT_BACKGROUND=true`
- setting the `--light-background` argument on the command line
- setting the variable `KUBECOLOR_PRESET="light"`
- configuring the config file ( `~/.kube/color.yaml`) with `preset: light`

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Dark" icon="moon">
    <SvgCommandOutput name="kubectl-describe-pod.svg" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Light" icon="sun">
    <SvgCommandOutput name="kubectl-describe-pod-light.svg" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
  Kubecolor does not do any automatic detection for wether light
  or dark theme should be used.

  It is technically possible for a shell program to detect your terminal's
  "dark/light mode preference".

  This is however not yet implemented. See tracking issue: [#124](https://github.com/kubecolor/kubecolor/issues/124)
:::

## Custom color theme

It is also possible to build your own color theme,
either by setting some variables or building up a config file.

For example:

<Tabs syncKey="config">
  <TabItem label="Environment variables">
  ```bash
  export KUBECOLOR_THEME_DATA_NULL="gray:italic"
  export KUBECOLOR_THEME_TABLE_HEADER="fg=white:bold:underline"
  export KUBECOLOR_THEME_STDERR_ERROR="fg=yellow:bg=red:bold"
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Config file">
  ```yaml
  # ~/.kube/color.yaml
  theme:
    data:
      "null": gray:italic
    table:
      header: fg=white:bold:underline
    stderr:
      error: fg=yellow:bg=red:bold
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To list all environment variables and config options, see:

- [Reference / Environment variables](/reference/environment-variables/)
- [Reference / Config file ~/.kube/color.yaml](/reference/config/)

## Fallback colors

Most of our color options have configured "fallback colors".
These config fields don't have a default value,
but instead rely on another config field as their value.

For example, the environment variable `KUBECOLOR_THEME_STATUS_SUCCESS`,
which is used in pod statuses like `Ready` and `Running`; does not have a default color.
Instead, it has a fallback to the `KUBECOLOR_THEME_BASE_SUCCESS` config field.

Similarly, the `KUBECOLOR_THEME_APPLY_CREATED` environment variable
(used on the "created" keyword in the `kubectl apply` command's output)
also has a fallback color to the same "base success" color.

This means that if you override `KUBECOLOR_THEME_BASE_SUCCESS` then you override
both of these use cases at the same time. I.e this:

<Tabs syncKey="config">
  <TabItem label="Environment variables">
  ```bash
  export KUBECOLOR_THEME_BASE_SUCCESS="light-blue:italic"
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Config file">
  ```yaml
  # ~/.kube/color.yaml
  theme:
    base:
      success: light-blue:italic
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Has the same effect as this:

<Tabs syncKey="config">
  <TabItem label="Environment variables">
  ```bash
  export KUBECOLOR_THEME_STATUS_SUCCESS="light-blue:italic"
  export KUBECOLOR_THEME_APPLY_CREATED="light-blue:italic"
  # omitting other uses of the "base.success" fallback color for brevity
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Config file">
  ```yaml
  # ~/.kube/color.yaml
  theme:
    apply:
      created: light-blue:italic
    status:
      success: light-blue:italic
    # omitting other uses of the "base.success" fallback color for brevity
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In effect, this means that you can modify the "base colors" and still adjust most
of kubecolor's output to your color preference,
while still allowing you to make finer adjustments where needed.

Additionally, this also acts as forward-compatibility, where kubecolor can add
new color config fields and they would still somewhat follow your current theme.

## Submitting new themes

We will happily accept any wild, goofy, awesome, super useful, and even weird themes
that you want to share with the world!

To submit one, please create a `~/.kube/color.yaml` file with the color overrides
for your theme and then create a [feature request issue](https://github.com/kubecolor/kubecolor/issues/new?template=feature.yml)
over on GitHub.
