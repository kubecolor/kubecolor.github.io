Kubecolor can be installed in various ways through a number of package managers.
If you don't have any of the package managers available, then consider [downloading the binary](#download-binary-via-github-release).

*The badges below each section show the latest version available for that package repository.
Green means that it's up-to-date, while red means outdated.*

## Prerequisites

As a prerequisite, you must first [install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).
Some packages listed below will install it for you. But some won't.

:::caution
  Because kubecolor internally calls `kubectl` command, if you are using unsupported kubectl version, it's also not supported by kubecolor.
  Kubernetes version support policy can be found in [official doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).

If you're getting the error <code>permission denied</code>  (common in environments like WSL):

error: error loading config file "/home/nonroot/.kube/config": open /home/nonroot/.kube/config: permission denied
```

then try changing the permission of your `~/.kube/config` file:

```sh
chmod 644 ~/.kube/config
```

## Debian/Ubuntu

[![Debian version](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/debian_unstable/kubecolor.svg)](https://repology.org/project/kubecolor/versions)

The Debian package (and its dervivatives like Ubuntu, elementary OS,
Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Zorin OS, etc) is very outdated and as such is
highly discouraged.

Please use a different mode for installing kubecolor.

## Missing a repository?

We only add new repositories and ways to install kubecolor on demand.
If you feel like your favorite package manager is missing,
