Kubecolor can be installed in various ways through a number of package managers.
If you don't have any of the package managers available, then consider [downloading the binary](#download-binary-via-github-release).

*The badges below each section show the latest version available for that package repository.
Green means that it's up-to-date, while red means outdated.*

## Prerequisites

As a prerequisite, you must first [install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).
Some packages listed below will install it for you. But some won't.

:::caution
  Because kubecolor internally calls `kubectl` command, if you are using unsupported kubectl version, it's also not supported by kubecolor.
  Kubernetes version support policy can be found in [official doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).

## Homebrew

[![Homebrew version](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/homebrew/kubecolor.svg)](https://repology.org/project/kubecolor/versions)

For MacOS (and some Linux) users using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

```bash
brew install kubecolor
```

:::note
If you previously installed `kubecolor` using the old `brew install kubecolor/tap/kubecolor` command, remove it first:

```bash
brew uninstall kubecolor
brew untap kubecolor/tap
brew update
brew install kubecolor
```

  <TabItem label="Graphical install">
    Our `.deb` files are self-bootstrapping, meaning you just have to
    install it and it will set up the repository for you so that you
    will get any future updates in your package manager.

    1. Download the `deb` file for your architecture [from the latest release](https://github.com/kubecolor/kubecolor/releases/latest)
       (found down at the "Assets")

    2. Install it using your package manager by opening the downloaded `deb` file

    3. Done 🎉

## Compile from source

Requires Go 1.22 (or later)

```sh
go install github.com/kubecolor/kubecolor@latest
```

## Docker

Running it via Docker can be nice for just trying out kubecolor:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $HOME/.kube:/home/nonroot/.kube:ro --env COLORTERM ghcr.io/kubecolor/kubecolor get pods
```

:::note
If you're getting the error <code>permission denied</code>  (common in environments like WSL):

```log
error: error loading config file "/home/nonroot/.kube/config": open /home/nonroot/.kube/config: permission denied
```

then try changing the permission of your `~/.kube/config` file:

```sh
chmod 644 ~/.kube/config
```
