Kubecolor can be installed in various ways through a number of package managers.
If you don't have any of the package managers available, then consider [downloading the binary](#download-binary-via-github-release).

*The badges below each section show the latest version available for that package repository.
Green means that it's up-to-date, while red means outdated.*

## Prerequisites

As a prerequisite, you must first [install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).
Some packages listed below will install it for you. But some won't.

:::caution
  Because kubecolor internally calls `kubectl` command, if you are using unsupported kubectl version, it's also not supported by kubecolor.
  Kubernetes version support policy can be found in [official doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).

## Homebrew

[![Homebrew version](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/homebrew/kubecolor.svg)](https://repology.org/project/kubecolor/versions)

```bash
brew install kubecolor
```

:::note
If you previously installed `kubecolor` using the old `brew install kubecolor/tap/kubecolor` command, remove it first:

```bash
brew uninstall kubecolor
brew untap kubecolor/tap
brew update
brew install kubecolor
```

    install it and it will set up the repository for you so that you
    will get any future updates in your package manager.

    1. Download the `deb` file for your architecture [from the latest release](https://github.com/kubecolor/kubecolor/releases/latest)
       (found down at the "Assets")

If you're getting the error <code>permission denied</code>  (common in environments like WSL):

```log
error: error loading config file "/home/nonroot/.kube/config": open /home/nonroot/.kube/config: permission denied
```

then try changing the permission of your `~/.kube/config` file:

```sh
chmod 644 ~/.kube/config
```
