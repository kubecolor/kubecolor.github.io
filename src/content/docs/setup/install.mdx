  order: 1
---

As a prerequisite, you must first [install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

:::caution
  Because kubecolor internally calls `kubectl` command, if you are using unsupported kubectl version, it's also not supported by kubecolor.
  Kubernetes version support policy can be found in [official doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).
:::

Kubecolor can be installed in various ways through a number of package managers.
If you don't have any of the package managers available, then consider [downloading the binary](#download-binary-via-github-release).

:::note
  We only add new repositories and ways to install kubecolor on demand.
  If you feel like your favorite package manager is missing,
  then please file a [feature request](https://github.com/kubecolor/kubecolor/issues/new?template=feature.yml).

:::note
If you're getting the error <code>permission denied</code>  (common in environments like WSL):

```log
error: error loading config file "/home/nonroot/.kube/config": open /home/nonroot/.kube/config: permission denied
```

then try changing the permission of your `~/.kube/config` file:

```sh
chmod 644 ~/.kube/config
```
