title: color[]
description: Config type "color list"
---

Similar to the [`color` type](/reference/types/color/), but allows multiple separate colors to be applied.
Commonly used to allow alternating colors on columns.

The colors are separated by a slash `/`.

Example:

```bash
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_TABLE_COLUMNS="red/green/blue"
```

Above represents a `color[]` value of 3 colors, where your columns'
color would cycle those colors: red, green, blue, red, green, blue, red, etc.

You can of course use any color syntax, to for example have it cycle on
background color with some style modifiers instead:

```bash
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_TABLE_COLUMNS="bg=red:underline/bg=green:italic/bg=blue:bold"
```
