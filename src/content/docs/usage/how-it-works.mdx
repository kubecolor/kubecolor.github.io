title: How it works
---

For the curious of how kubecolor behaves, here's a rundown.

Simply put:

1. Parse the arguments to understand which subcommand it is. For example:

   ```bash
   kubecolor --kubecolor-theme="light" get --pager="less" pods -o wide --watch
   ```

2. Parse subcommand and kubecolor-specific flags:

   - "subcommand is `get`"
   - "flag `--output` is set to `wide`"
   - "flag `--watch` is set to `true`"
   - "set kubecolor theme to `light`"
   - "set pager to `less`"

3. Prepare `kubectl` subcommand, filtering out kubecolor-specific flags,
   turning the command into:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -o wide --watch
   ```

4. If it's a subcommand that doesn't support colors
   (e.g `kubectl exec` or kubectl plugins), then just give provide
   the `kubectl` command with the raw stdin, stdout, and stderr pipes,
   and then just let it execute.

5. If paging is enabled and it's a subcommand that supports paging,
   then start up the pager process (e.g `less -RF`) and pipe kubecolor's
   output through it. Effectively doing this:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -o wide --watch | kubecolor-parsing-logic | less -RF
   ```

6. Select the correct parser and printer for the associated subcommand.
   For example `kubectl get` -> "table printer" and
   `kubectl --help` -> "help printer".

   > Side note: Most of kubecolor's code base is in the parsers.
   > Parsing arbitrary `kubectl describe` output and
   > `kubectl get` tables (with potential empty cells) is non-trivial.

7. Let the code fly, continuously parsing and printing as the `kubectl`
   process is outputting data.

8. Upon exit, reuse `kubectl`'s exit code.

Kubecolor does not talk to the Kubernetes API at all.
The only IO it performs is executing the `kubectl` (and potential pager)
processes and parsing the results.

If we were to fork kubectl's code base, then we could probably add a lot of
colorization with deep levels of domain knowledge about the output.
But that is an unreasonable amount of work.

Instead, with this approach, kubecolor is arguably way more flexible,
and it also allows us to support the OpenShift `oc` command at the same time.

### Dynamic tty support

When the kubecolor output tty is not standard output, it automatically disables the colorization.
For example:

```bash
# Prints with color codes
kubecolor get pods

# Automatically disables color codes for these two:
kubecolor get pods > result.txt
kubecolor get pods | grep Running

# Force kubecolor to print color codes anyways
kubecolor get pods --force-colors > result.txt
```

### Dynamic color support

Kubecolor will infer which colors your terminal supports.

For context, practically all terminals supports the basic ["3-bit" or "4-bit" ANSI color set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit)
which includes 8 or 16 different colors (respectively),
while most support the ["8-bit" ANSI color set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit)
which, includes 256 different colors.
More advanced and modern terminal emulators also support the ["24-bit" color set (aka true color)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#24-bit),
which includes the famous 16 777 216 number of colors,
and are most commonly referred to by their RGB (e.g `rgb(90, 12, 135)`) or HEX (e.g `#5a8487`) representations.

When using kubecolor you can freely configure it to use RGB values in your [theme](#color-theme),
and depending on your terminal's color support, it will convert the color to the nearest 8-bit or 4-bit color.

The color support can be overridden via the `--force-colors` flag and `KUBECOLOR_FORCE_COLORS` environment variable,
and it support multiple values: `auto`, `basic`, `256`, `truecolor`, and `none`

```bash
# As an example, let's set the header color to a 24-bit/truecolor value:
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_TABLE_HEADER='#5a8487'

# Automatically detect color support,
# but fallback to basic/4-bit colors if detection fails
kubecolor get pods --force-colors=auto

# Force colors to basic/4-bit colors,
# resulting in header color code `␛[37m`
kubecolor get pods --force-colors=basic

# Force colors to 256/8-bit colors,
# resulting in header color code `␛[38;5;66m`
kubecolor get pods --force-colors=256

# Force colors to truecolor/24-bit colors,
# resulting in header color code `␛[38;2;90;132;135m`
kubecolor get pods --force-colors=truecolor

# Forcing no colors, i.e. disabling colors
kubecolor get pods --force-colors=none
```

When not using the `--force-colors` flag or `KUBECOLOR_FORCE_COLORS` env var,
the behavior then depends on if the output is a terminal or not:

```bash
# Same behavior as --force-colors=auto
kubecolor get pods

# Same behavior as --force-colors=none
kubecolor get pods > result.txt
kubecolor get pods | grep Running
```

How kubecolor figures this out is through some standards using the
`COLORTERM` environment variable and `TERMINFO` files,
where we rely on the [github.com/gookit/color package's detection logic](https://github.com/gookit/color/blob/v1.5.4/detect_env.go#L29-L183).

:::caution
  If running `kubecolor` in a restrictive environment such as a Docker container,
  then make sure to give it all the hints of your intended color support.

  This can be done by forwarding your `--env COLORTERM` environment variable,
  or by setting the support level explicitly via the `--force-colors=256` flag
  or `KUBECOLOR_FORCE_COLORS=256` environment variable.
